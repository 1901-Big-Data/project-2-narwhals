# project-2-narwhals

We (Austin Hunter, Johnathan Shoberg, Josheph Spencer) are planning to use fishing data to open our own fishery; Narwhal Fishing Inc. We want to evaluate prior fishing records in order to find where the greatest yields are located, so that our fisherman can haul in the largest bounty. We can also evaluate each fish's value and determine which catch will yield the most sale value.

The data set (courtesy of 'https://www.ices.dk/marine-data/dataset-collections/Pages/Fish-catch-and-stock-assessment.aspx') was imported using sqoop into an Amazon RDS database using MySQL as its engine. There, it will be transformed and moved into HIVE where we will begin business analysis.
